3. Set permissions: sudo chmod 640 /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf

4. Add your user to the 'mail' group: sudo usermod -a -G mail $(whoami)

The user that gets all mail for user IDs < 1000

Points directly to the SMTP server (removed the google search redirect)

mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587

This is NOT your regular Gmail password.

You must generate an "App Password" from your Google Account settings.

1. Go to myaccount.google.com

2. Go to Security -> 2-Step Verification

3. At the bottom, click "App Passwords"

4. Select "Mail" for the app and "Other (Custom name)" for the device.

5. Name it "RaspberryPi" or similar.

6. Google will give you a 16-character password. Use that password here.

AuthPass=YOUR_16_CHARACTER_APP_PASSWORD

Use STARTTLS

UseSTARTTLS=YES

Use TLS

UseTLS=YES

This rewrites the "From:" line of the email to match AuthUser

FromLineOverride=YES
